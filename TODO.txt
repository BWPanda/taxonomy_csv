=====================

UI
  o    display result of import
  o    display errors in original file
  o    create vocabulary
  o    dynamic examples (related to the choice of the source option)
  o    import by a text area
  X62b add link to use module after installation
  o    remind previous values for csv delimiter and utf-8 import
  o    do a uninstall hook if remind previous values is done
  o    advertise for remove when there is only one column and update is chosen.

Functions
  o    import of structured alphabetic terms list
  o    option to import sub-relations and not only relations to first term
  o    import of ancestors and not children (useful?)
  o    use of parent of previous line for children without root 0
  o    parent merge (polyhierarchy)
  X62b distinction between description and synonyms
  o    multiple files import
  o    sensitive or not to uppercase / lowercase
  o    import of iso 2788 as in taxonomy_xml (but KISS approach)
  o    integrate or reference to taxonomy_manager
  o    remove selected terms

Code / security
  o    remove query and use only Drupal core ones and php filters (useful?)
  o    see if there is Drupal functions to import only synonyms or related etc.
  o    manage and inform on input error
  o    factorize code
  o    redo a cache
  o    clean the input line at the beginning of process and never after
  o    use taxonomy_parser?
  o    change the type of vocabulary (flat, monohierarchy, polyhierarchy)
  o    add hook_perm
  o    add hook_info
  o    replace _taxonomy_csv_parse_size by a Drupal function
  o    no order to import vocabulary files

Documentation

  o    more examples
  o    image view and presentation text for project page
  o    translations
