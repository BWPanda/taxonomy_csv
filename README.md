Taxonomy CSV Import/Export
==========================


This module allows to import or export taxonomy from or to a CSV
(comma-separated values) local or distant file or a copy-and-paste text.

When you want to quick import a non-standardized vocabulary, for example an
old thesaurus or a simple list of children, synonyms, related terms,
descriptions or weights of a set of terms, Taxonomy CSV is simpler to use. 

Warning
-------

Use at your risk. Even if many informations are displayed, taxonomy_csv module
does not tell you what it's gonna do before it's doing it, so make sure you have
a backup so you can roll back if necessary.

It's recommended to use the "autocreate" or the "duplicate vocabulary" choices
to check your csv file before import in a true vocabulary.
